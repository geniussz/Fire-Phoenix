> * Project Title: Advanced forest fire model and its self-organized criticality

## General Introduction

Diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon which refers to the process in which a substance or property spreads from one region to another, e.g, transfer of heat, virus spreading etc..

In this project, we will investigate the spreading of forest fire. In 1992, a famous forest fire model was introduced based on the Cellular Automata by Drossel and Schwabl. In 1995, Albano introduced a more generalized forest fire model considering the immunity from fire and the finite-size forest. Thus, during the past decades, researchers have shown a strong interest in the self-organized criticality, which is introduced by Bak et al. to describe the system evolves into a steady critical state irrespective of its initial conditions. Many actual systems including the spreading of forest fire are claimed to have the self-organized criticality behavior or power-law relationships. Power-law distributions of natural or man-made hazards provide important information on risk assessment and hazard protection.


## The Model

We will use our advanced forest fire model to study how the fire spread (measure the burned area) with time, ignition probability, different weather condition, etc.. Compared to standard forest fire model, we will consider more factors including the density of forest and different weather conditions to make simulation results fit better with real case. With this model, we will study the self-organized criticality by calculating the size distribution of fire clusters.  


## Fundamental Questions

How is the relationship between the burned area and time?

How is the relationship between the burned area and the ignition probability?

What are the characteristics (quantitative) of a self-organized critical state? 

How do different weather conditions interfere the self-organized critical state?

How does the self-organized criticality depend on the neighbourhood selection on the grid? 


## Expected Results

The forest fire system evolves into a steady critical state irrespective of its initial conditions. 
The size distribution of forest fire satisfied a good power law.
If considering different weather conditions, the forest fire model still shows its self-organized criticality.
